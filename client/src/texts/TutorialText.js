    "Only one player can reach the end first, and the order of players adding their cards to the progress bar is randomized every turn.",

    "All players have an 'energy' bar, showing the strength you have left to continue looting rooms. If your value hits zero, you'll stumble on your journey, and reset your score back to zero.",

    "At the beginning of each turn (before players have selected a card) the room card will target player(s) to lose energy. If the round is not completed (progress bar not filled) during the turn, player(s) will lose energy as the room card specifies.",

    "Likewise, if you're the targeted player, you may choose to speed up the round's progress by playing high value cards, rather than aiming to win that room's points and risk losing energy.",
